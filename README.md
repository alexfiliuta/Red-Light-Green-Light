# Red Light Green Light Game

This repository contains a simple web application inspired by the "Red Light, Green Light" game from the popular TV show Squid Game. The game is built using React and styled with CSS. Players must click on the traffic light only when it is coloured green. The colour will randomly switch between green and light. If the player clicks on the red light the game is over. In order to win, the player needs to score 15 points before the time has passed.

## Features

- **Simple UI:** A simple user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players are challenged with random intervals of red and green lights.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Click the start button to begin the game.
2. **Click on Green:** You can click as many times as you want when the light is green.
3. **Stop on Red:** Stop immediately when the light turns red. Clicking during a red light will result in losing the game.
